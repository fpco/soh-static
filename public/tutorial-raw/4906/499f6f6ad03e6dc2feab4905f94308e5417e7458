I'm going to try a few new things today.

First, I'm trying to write a post using the School of Haskell.

Second, I'm going to try to work through some code in a rather collaborative fashion. That is to say, I have a general idea of where I'm going and how to make it fast, but I have yet to do so and I'd like to actively encourage you to help me figure it out.

So, what are we hacking on?

I was recently reminded by Carter Schonwald about some properties of Morton ordering that turned out to be particularly relevant to sparse matrix multiplication. Along the way I discovered a particularly nice formulation of the problem, and I figured it would be a fun way to get my feet wet writing stuff here. 

Hopefully, this series will have a bit of something for everybody: Some lenses, some bit bashing, worries about cache coherence, stream fusion, nice recursion patterns, finding simpler formulations for traditional algorithms, and general functional programming fun.

I'll also try to call out opportunities for readers to help as I go along. Particularly in the later parts, there will be a lot of room for improvement and many hands make light work!

The code for this project is available on github at [github.com/ekmett/sparse](https://github.com/ekmett/sparse) if you are impatient and want to skip ahead. It isn't quite the last page in a murder mystery, and I haven't been shy about talking about this stuff, but I fully intend to crank away on development in there, so it may get pretty far in advance of these posts -- especially if you are late to the party!

Later on, we'll get to some numerics, and maybe they'll even perform decently, but today is mostly just setting up key space.

I'm hoping that by throwing open development a bit, I can help showcase a bit about how I think and attack a new problem as a Haskell programmer.

The latter parts are definitely currently unoptimized, but showcase what I think is a new technique (or at least a "new to me" technique) that I want to play with.

With all that out of the way, lets move on to

Morton Ordering
===============

[Morton ordering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve) (aka the Z-curve) is a technique for getting cache locality in multiple dimensions by interleaving the bits of your different keys rather than storing them lexicographically. It was discovered way back in 1966, so I figured it was time to  write up an article about it.

![z-order](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Four-level_Z.svg/600px-Four-level_Z.svg.png)

The idea is that instead of picking one of the keys to put first you interleave their bits. Now, you are in some sense slightly screwed up when it comes to sorting by either axis, but you're more or less equally screwed no matter which way you go, and you're less screwed than you would be if you were cutting row-wise across a column-major or column-wise across a row-major ordered version of things. In general you get to exploit locality in either dimension to some degree. The extra locality you get isn't as good as you can get with a proper [Hilbert curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) or with one of the other high end space filling curves, but those start requiring a lot more bit twiddling. 

(If someone wants to follow along the later parts with a Hilbert or H curve and find where my tricks fail, I'd love to see the result!)

I want to work through how we can work with keys in Morton order in two ways. Today I'll walk through the first way.

Neither of these techniques is particularly new, but having at least one of them is necessary for what is to come.

[Every Day I'm Shuffling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ6zr6kCPj8&t=3m38s)
========================

We can turn to [Hacker's Delight](http://www.hackersdelight.org/) to find a routine for interleaving the high and low parts of a word together.

```c
unsigned shuffle1(unsigned x) {
// ------------------------------ cut ----------------------------------
   x = (x & 0x0000FF00) << 8 | (x >> 8) & 0x0000FF00 | x & 0xFF0000FF;
   x = (x & 0x00F000F0) << 4 | (x >> 4) & 0x00F000F0 | x & 0xF00FF00F;
   x = (x & 0x0C0C0C0C) << 2 | (x >> 2) & 0x0C0C0C0C | x & 0xC3C3C3C3;
   x = (x & 0x22222222) << 1 | (x >> 1) & 0x22222222 | x & 0x99999999;
// ---------------------------- end cut --------------------------------
   return x;
}
```

What this does is take a bunch of bits like

```text
abcd efgh ijkl mnop ABCD EFGH IJKL MNOP
```

and then shuffles them until they are fully interleaved in parallel within the word carefully. 

```text
abcd efgh ABCD EFGH ijkl mnop IJKL MNOP
abcd ABCD efgh EFGH ijkl IJKL mnop MNOP
abAB cdCD efEF ghGH ijIJ klKL mnMN opOP
aAbB cCdD eEfF gGhH iIjJ kKlL mMnN oOpP
```

We can view this technique perhaps as an early precursor to something out of the more the modern SWAR (SIMD within a register) [toolbox](http://aggregate.org/SWAR/Dis/dissertation.pdf), but we'll be doing everything by hand.

Now, I want to work with slightly larger keys, and I'd rather work in Haskell, so we can transcode that and reimplement it to work on larger word sizes with appropriate tweaks to the constants involved.

```active haskell
-- show
import Data.Bits
import Data.Word
import Control.Lens
import Numeric.Lens
-- /show

-- show
shuffle :: Word64 -> Word64
shuffle k0 = k5 where
  k1 = unsafeShiftL (k0 .&. 0x00000000FFFF0000) 16 .|. unsafeShiftR k0 16 .&. 0x00000000FFFF0000 .|. k0 .&. 0xFFFF00000000FFFF
  k2 = unsafeShiftL (k1 .&. 0x0000FF000000FF00) 8  .|. unsafeShiftR k1 8  .&. 0x0000FF000000FF00 .|. k1 .&. 0xFF0000FFFF0000FF
  k3 = unsafeShiftL (k2 .&. 0x00F000F000F000F0) 4  .|. unsafeShiftR k2 4  .&. 0x00F000F000F000F0 .|. k2 .&. 0xF00FF00FF00FF00F
  k4 = unsafeShiftL (k3 .&. 0x0C0C0C0C0C0C0C0C) 2  .|. unsafeShiftR k3 2  .&. 0x0C0C0C0C0C0C0C0C .|. k3 .&. 0xC3C3C3C3C3C3C3C3
  k5 = unsafeShiftL (k4 .&. 0x2222222222222222) 1  .|. unsafeShiftR k4 1  .&. 0x2222222222222222 .|. k4 .&. 0x9999999999999999
-- /show

-- show main
main = print $ base 2 # shuffle 0x00000000FFFFFFFF
-- /show

```

Now we can build our `Key` type:

```haskell
newtype Key = Key Word64

key :: Word32 -> Word32 -> Key
key i j = Key $ shuffle $ unsafeShiftL (fromIntegral i) 32 .|. fromIntegral j
```

For convenience, it'd be nice to see what the key was originally to show it, and later on to be able to project it back out, so first, lets define an `unshuffle`.

```active haskell
import Data.Bits
import Data.Word
import Control.Lens
import Numeric.Lens

-- show
unshuffle :: Word64 -> Word64
unshuffle k0 = k5 where
  t0 = xor k0 (unsafeShiftR k0 1 ) .&. 0x2222222222222222
  k1 = k0 `xor` t0 `xor` unsafeShiftL t0 1
  t1 = xor k1 (unsafeShiftR k1 2 ) .&. 0x0C0C0C0C0C0C0C0C
  k2 = k1 `xor` t1 `xor` unsafeShiftL t1 2
  t2 = xor k2 (unsafeShiftR k2 4 ) .&. 0x00F000F000F000F0
  k3 = k2 `xor` t2 `xor` unsafeShiftL t2 4
  t3 = xor k3 (unsafeShiftR k3 8 ) .&. 0x0000FF000000FF00
  k4 = k3 `xor` t3 `xor` unsafeShiftL t3 8
  t4 = xor k4 (unsafeShiftR k4 16) .&. 0x00000000FFFF0000
  k5 = k4 `xor` t4 `xor` unsafeShiftL t4 16
-- /show
{-# INLINE unshuffle #-}

-- show main
main = print $ base 2 # unshuffle 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
-- /show
```

Interestingly, with `-fllvm`, that change, and a high enough optimization level, GHC is smart enough to realize `shuffle . unshuffle = id`!

With that, we can implement

```haskell
unkey :: Key -> (Word32, Word32)
```

Now, we have what we need to make an isomorphism.

We could define

```haskell
keyed :: Iso' (Word32,Word32) Key
keyed = iso (uncurry key) unkey
```

and then we could expose field accessors that work like Key was a pair using the overloaded field accessors in `lens`:

```haskell
instance Field1 Key Key Word32 Word32 where
  _1 = from keyed._1

instance Field2 Key Key Word32 Word32 where
  _2 = from keyed._2
```

With this we can take a key, and freely manipulate one side of it with the lens combinators. e.g.

```haskell
key 100 200 ^. _2 = 200
key 100 200 & _2 .~ 300 = key 100 300
```

and we can use these to make a custom `Show` and `Read` for our `Key` type that isn't so eyebleedingly tough to read:

```haskell
instance Show Key where
  showsPrec d w = case unkey w of
    (i,j) -> showParen (d > 10) $
      showString "key " . Prelude.showsPrec 11 i .
           showChar ' ' . Prelude.showsPrec 11 j

instance Read Key where
  readsPrec d = readParen (d > 10) $ \r ->
    [ (key i j, u)
    | ("key",s) <- lex r
    , (i,t) <- readsPrec 11 s
    , (j,u) <- readsPrec 11 t
    ]
```

now most users don't need to care too much about the internal implementation of `Key`.

That said, we revisit our awesomely succinct implementation for `_1` and `_2` above, because we can implement `_1` and `_2` much more efficiently if we don't bother to shuffle and unshuffle the other side at all!

Fortunately, once again the Hacker's Delight has our backs.

This time I'm going to encode the indexed lens directly rather than compose it out of simpler pieces:

```haskell
-- | Masks for the interleaved components of a key
m1, m2 :: Word64
m1 = 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -- the mask for the first component of our key.
m2 = 0x5555555555555555 -- the mask for the second component of our key.
{-# INLINE m1 #-}
{-# INLINE m2 #-}

instance (a ~ Word32, b ~ Word32) => Field2 Key Key a b where
  _2 f (Key ij) = indexed f (1 :: Int) (fromIntegral k5) <&> \j -> let
         j0 = fromIntegral j
         j1 = unsafeShiftL (j0 .&. 0x00000000FFFF0000) 16 .|. j0 .&. 0xFFFF00000000FFFF
         j2 = unsafeShiftL (j1 .&. 0x0000FF000000FF00) 8  .|. j1 .&. 0xFF0000FFFF0000FF
         j3 = unsafeShiftL (j2 .&. 0x00F000F000F000F0) 4  .|. j2 .&. 0xF00FF00FF00FF00F
         j4 = unsafeShiftL (j3 .&. 0x0C0C0C0C0C0C0C0C) 2  .|. j3 .&. 0xC3C3C3C3C3C3C3C3
         j5 = unsafeShiftL (j4 .&. 0x2222222222222222) 1  .|. j4 .&. 0x9999999999999999
      in Key (ij .&. m1 .|. j5)
    where
      k0 = ij .&. m2
      k1 = (unsafeShiftR k0 1  .|. k0) .&. 0x3333333333333333
      k2 = (unsafeShiftR k1 2  .|. k1) .&. 0x0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F
      k3 = (unsafeShiftR k2 4  .|. k2) .&. 0x00FF00FF00FF00FF
      k4 = (unsafeShiftR k3 8  .|. k3) .&. 0x0000FFFF0000FFFF
      k5 = (unsafeShiftR k4 16 .|. k4) .&. 0x00000000FFFFFFFF
```

Here _2 is being made manually into an 'indexed lens' (really just to make the Field typeclass happy), it is always index 1, and it half-unshuffles out the right hand side of my `Word64` to make a Word32 suitable for consumption, and when given a replacement, shuffles it into place, and masks off what it is replacing in the `Key`.

I had a slightly fiddly issue with the signature that arose, because I needed to use a type equality rather than the more obvious `Field2 Key Key Word32 Word32` instance to make it so that `(.~)` selects the right instance.

Exercise: Try changing it to the obvious version in the module at the bottom of this file and see what happens to main!

His solution resolves the shifts on `k5`, but not `i0`. Can we do better? Why or why not?

The current implementation of this code, with whatever changes have been made in the meantime, sans some cleanup for presentation is currently available as [Sparse/Matrix/Key.hs](https://github.com/ekmett/sparse/blob/master/src/Sparse/Matrix/Key.hs).

Now we can compare two keys for Morton order just by embedding them and comparing them, but can we do better?

[A Strange Game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOoXwxqeVzg)
================

I'll pick up next time with how we can compare two keys by their Morton ordering without actually performing the interleaving at all! This technique will be important in what is to come, even if we may not use it directly for the keys themselves.

Hopefully by parts 3 or 4 we'll be deep in the bowels of Vector carving up custom stream fusion combinators and rethinking whether we want to partition a matrix or "thin" it to build an efficient sparse matrix multiplication routine. 

I've included a current copy of the `Key` code below as an active document with minor alterations to enable you to play with it interactively. (It has a few cosmetic differences from the code above.)
