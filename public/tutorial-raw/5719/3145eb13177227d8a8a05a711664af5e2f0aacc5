This thing you are about to see is so epic that you will catch a illness called old age and it will KILL YOU! 

``` active haskell 
main = print (f "I will" " kill"  " YOU")
f m x n= m ++ x ++n
```

If you figured out this "machine", you are hunted. Buh buh buh (o great, that is not how you spel laughter!)
