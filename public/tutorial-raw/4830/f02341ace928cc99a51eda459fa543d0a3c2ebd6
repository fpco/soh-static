Hi, welcome to my first tutorial on *School of Haskell*.

It was designed to be the simplest tutorial here ever.

How to read
===========

Just read the paragraphs.

How to try
==========

Live snippets
-------------

When a *live snippet* appears, like:

```active haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello world!"
```

Just click the *Play* button ("Run this code") to run it. Discard the result with the *Close* button (the big red cross).

Tweaking live snippets
----------------------

But it's not enough to run code to learn properly. You have to tweak it.

Please fix the snippet below, and run it:

```active haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello worl!"
```

If lost, you can always come back to the original code with the *Back* button ("Reset changes"). Try to
make the typo (you just fixed above) reappear!

Advanced examples
=================

In some snippets, the creator of the tutorial wants you to focus on the interesting lines. She can hide the other lines in the first place, but you can always see them with the *Document* button (Show the rest of this code).


```active haskell
-- HAHA!!! this line was hidden
-- show
main = putStrLn "Hello world!"
-- /show
```

Web hacking with Yesod
======================

If you are interested in web development, you should check
[the first Yesod tutorial](https://haskell.fpcomplete.com/school/basics-of-yesod/yesod-1).

Now it's your turn
==================

It's really easy to create *your* tutorial, and help others learn Haskell. Now please follow
[this tutorial: School of Haskell Markdown](https://haskell.fpcomplete.com/school/soh-markdown)
which explains how.

*Happy hacking!!!*
