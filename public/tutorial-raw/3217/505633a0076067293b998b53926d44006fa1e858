So, we have to find out the last modification date of the file and display this date based on the current timezone. Timezone name must be specified in the standard three-letter form.

### Solution


We have to install packages [`directory`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/directory) and [`time`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/time), and after that:


```haskell
module Main where

import System.Directory (getModificationTime)
import Data.Time.LocalTime (getCurrentTimeZone,
                            utcToLocalTime,
                            timeZoneName)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    utcTime <- getModificationTime "/Users/dshevchenko/my.conf"
    zone <- getCurrentTimeZone
    let localTime = utcToLocalTime zone utcTime
    putStrLn $ show localTime ++ " " ++ timeZoneName zone

```

Result is something like this:

```bash
2014-05-18 21:53:39 MSK
```

That's it.
