Here is an example active snippet which will auto-run when the page loads. The code is written as

    ``` haskell active autorun
    main = print "Hello, World!"
    ```

And will result in the following:

``` haskell active autorun
main = print "Hello, World!"
```

Note that the second snippet will not automatically run:

``` haskell active autorun
main = print "Hello, World!"
```
